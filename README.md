# Analysis of Mielec for New Police Station Location

## Overview
This project presents an analysis of the city of Mielec aimed at determining the optimal location for a new police station. The analysis was carried out using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools and evaluated multiple factors, including crime rates, land availability, distance to existing police stations, and land prices.

## Methodology
The analysis involved the following steps, each represented by a map:

### 1. Data Loading
The relevant data for this analysis were imported, including:
- Roads
- Land parcels
- Land usage
- Locations of existing police stations
- Crime areas

This data serves as the foundation for identifying potential areas for the new station.

### 2. Selection of Suitable Land Based on Usage
Land plots that meet the criteria for public utility use were selected, retaining only areas permitted for police station development for further analysis.

### 3. Filtering for Minimum Plot Size (800m²)
Plots smaller than 800m² were excluded to ensure sufficient space for the construction of the police station.

### 4. Trimming Plots to Meet All Criteria
Land plots were refined based on previous criteria (e.g., land use, size), resulting in a list of suitable locations.

### 5. Exclusion of Areas Close to Existing Police Stations
Plots within a 1 km radius of existing police stations were excluded to prevent overlapping service areas.

### 6. Identification of High Crime Areas
High-crime areas were identified, with priority given to locations where a police station would be most beneficial.

### 7. Selection of Plots Near High Crime Areas
The suitable land plots were cross-referenced with high-crime areas, ensuring that potential station locations would be close to areas in need of enhanced law enforcement.

### 8. Evaluation of Two Best Plots by Price per Square Meter
Two top plots were selected based on their price per square meter, considering a balance between cost and location effectiveness.

### 9. Final Plot Selection for New Police Station
After evaluating all criteria, the best plot was selected for the new police station. This plot meets all requirements, including size, distance from existing stations, proximity to high-crime areas, and price.

## Conclusion
This analysis identified the most optimal location for constructing a new police station in Mielec, considering a combination of crime data, plot size, distance from existing police stations, and land prices. The final map highlights the selected plot as the best option.
